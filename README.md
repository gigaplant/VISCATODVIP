# VISCA TO DVIP

This Python script is used to listen on the localhost on UDP port 1259, amend the data packet to match the DVIP protocol and forward onto a Datavideo PTZ Camera.

Run this script on the same machine as you run VMix, Wirecast..etc and set the PTZ type to "PTZOptics UDP" and the ip address to 127.0.0.1
